-----------Glass Identification Data Set---------------
The dataset consists of different instances of glass segments, each object/instance containing information on the chemical composition of the segment. Our goals is to group those instances into groups/clusters of similar instances. There is also a class attribute ( Type              of glass   ) which  must not be used for clustering but can be used for the evaluation of the clustering results.
